      "content": "Hi there,\n\nI have built an almost exact replica of an S500 drone I already have, which is flying fine.  \nThe specs are:\n\n  * PixracerPro (This is the only different component to the existing drone, which has a Pixracer)\n  * 4S battery\n  * Brother Hobby 900 KV Avenger V3 motors\n  * TMotor F45A ESCs (interfaced with Dshot600 on channels Main 1-4)\n\nThe Problem:\n\n  * The main problem is that after arming, I can increase the rotor speed by putting more throttle, but it never reaches as high RPM as the other drone and doesnâ€™t take off. \n    * One subâ€‘problem is that there is a lot of drift in the state estimation, I donâ€™t really care about odometry but the pitch and roll donâ€™t look stable in the logs. See this log file, where I used Manual mode, so the pitch and roll estimates are used for control.  \nIn the motor outputs section, you can clearly see that right after boot, the motors spin at the same speed, but as the drift accumulates, the drone tries to counteract by throttling some motors down.\n    * In this other log file I have switched on Acro mode, so the estimator is not used for control. Here, we see that the motor outputs are nicely going up to 1.0 in synchrony. But still, the drone doesnâ€™t take off, even though itâ€™s close at full throttle. Also, after roughly 70 % throttle, the rpm donâ€™t audibly increase. I would like to first get this problem sorted, as I see it more problematic.\n\nWhat Iâ€™ve tried (nothing helped):\n\n  * Switching to PWM communication between ESC and PixracerPro, and calibrating it.\n  * Measured resistances to rule out that the motors donâ€™t get enough current. Everyting is at roughl 0.1 Ohm, so should be fine\n  * Tightened the lock nuts, from the impression on the props, it looks like the motors are not free spinning.\n  * Throtteling without props. Audibly it sounds like the motors stop spinning faster at the same 70 % throttle.\n  * Made a slow-mo of the props while spinning, they go the right way around.\n\nSome general things comparing the new drone to the old one:\n\n  * the pitch of the ESC bootup sequence seems lower.\n  * the bootup sequence does not go 123 1 3(1 is low pitch, 3 is high pitch) but only 123. So according to the doc the esc does not detect the 0 throttle position and does not signal readiness, even though afterwards it allows spinning the props. But this should not be a problem because Iâ€™m using Dshot, should it?\n  * For comparison, this flight log is from the the other functioning drone. The odometry also drifts during throttleâ€‘up but after takeoff, pitch and roll become stable.\n\nI kind of ran out of ideas, so would appreciate ideas a lot for things I could try or I should fix.  \nThanks already!\n\nlordreas",

      "content": "@lordreas These are indeed abnormal readings for the state estimator. I will look into that with more detail, I would need some time to study it properly. For the throttle output, have you already tried to swap the Pixracer with the Pixracer Pro into the current setup and see if the issue is still there? Also, the Pixracer Pro may be unable to communicate with the ESC. Iâ€™m wondering if you could please share the output of `dshot status`. In the meantime, I will try to schedule a space to use my measurement tools to see if the current firmware/configuration is causing this issue.",
